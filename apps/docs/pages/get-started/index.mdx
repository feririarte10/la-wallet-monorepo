# Get started

You can also contribute to the LaWallet ecosystem. Take a look at this document to understand how you can do it.

# Overview

This guide is intended to help you set up the LaWallet front end on your local network.

Follow these steps to start modifying the app's source code

<Steps>
### Cloning the repository

To start contributing to the project, clone it to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lawalletio/la-wallet-monorepo.git
```

### Installing Node.js and pnpm

You need to install <strong>Nodejs v18.17</strong> or higher and <strong>pnpm@8.10</strong><br/>
If the versions are not correct or you don't have Node.js or pnpm installed, download and follow their setup instructions:

- Install Node.js from the <Link className="text-blue-500" href="https://nodejs.org/en">official website</Link>

- Install <Link className="text-blue-500" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">pnpm</Link>

### Installing dependences

Once in the project's root directory, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

After the install completes, pnpm links packages across the project for development

### Running dev

To start the local development playground, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command will compile all the packages in watch-mode and start the LaWallet webapp in development mode

### Last step

If there was no error, the LaWallet webapp should already be started on your local network
By default, the application opens on port 3000. You must enter http://localhost:3000 to check if everything is fine.

</Steps>

# You finished!

You are now able to begin editing the application's source code, and any modifications you make will be instantly reflected on the local site.
